<p>HARDサマーワークショップ第２回目で学んだことをベースにして次のプロジェクトを実施しよう。プロジェクトの達成に必要な知識はネットや書籍などで獲得してください。</p>
<p>World Robot Summit</p>
<p>1. Robot Guide Test<br />
The Robot Guide Tests aim for a robot to simulate a guide dog leading a blind or visually impaired person around obstacles. Every time it encounters an obstacle, the robot has to indicate where the obstacle is for the blind/visually impaired person in effective and creative way so that the robot and the person can go around obstacles (without hitting).</p>
<p>2. Speech Recognition Test<br />
Speech Recognition Test aims to simulate a home assistant in helping elderly and people with disabilities at home as a communication partner. The robot needs to respond to questions that a person asks.</p>
<p>3. Assisted Service Robot Test<br />
The Assisted Service Robots Test aims to simulate a service dog in helping people who have disabilities. The robot is required to be able to communicate with the owner to understand the owner’s needs or instructions in order to provide appropriate assistance. A list of tasks that teams can use will be announced two months before the competition.</p>
