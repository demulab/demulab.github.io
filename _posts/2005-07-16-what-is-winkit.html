<p><strong>Origin</strong><br />
Demura Laboratory  in Kanazawa Institute of Technology (K.I.T.) tried to participate in RoboCup Japan Open 1999 which was held in Nagayo. It is the origin of a RoboCup team in K.I.T. Two students from department of mechanical engineering  joined in our robocup project when we had been preparing for RoboCup Japan Open 99.   It was entirely due to students' perseverance that we could participate RoboCup Japan Open 99.  However the result of it was miserable.</p>
<p>However, all project member did not want to quit the project, so we had decided to participate RoboCup 1999 which was held in Stockholm. I negotiated some companies and K.I.T to support<br />
our project. Finally, K.I.T. kindly adopted our project as one of Yumekobo, Factory for Dreams and Ideas,  projects in Jun 1999. The team name was Matto named after the place of K.I.T. Human Information Systems  Laboratory, and we participated in RoboCup 1999. The result was 2 wins and 4 loses. From September 1999,  I have been an adviser and Mr. Asano has been a manager of the  WinKIT team which our students named.</p>
<p><strong>Team Name</strong><br />
Students decided WinKIT in 1999.  The meaning are  Win （Win） + KIT (Kanazawa Institute of Technology） and Wink (Wink） + KIT (K.I.T.）.</p>

<p><strong>Why is  WinKIT pretty strong ?</strong><br />
K.I.T.'s original educational system which is called Yumekobo, Factory for Dreams and Ideas, makes WinKIT pretty strong.</p>
