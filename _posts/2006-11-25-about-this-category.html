<p>This category is powered by  <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">Babel Fish Translation</a>. Sorry for strange English.</p>
<p>Here,   there are tutorials about ODE (Open Dynamics Engine), and some simple programs for beginners, such as, the petit RoboCup middle size robot simulatori, the 3 DOF robot arm petit simulator, the petit evil biped robot simulator. Please enjoy them.</p>
<p>The ODE related book was born from this tutorials.</p>
<p>I would very appreciate if someone corrects strange English.</p>
