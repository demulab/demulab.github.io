<p class="MsoNormal">This page is mainly translated from http://demura.net/archives/9ode by http://translation.infoseek.co.jp.</p>

<p>A Humanoid Robot Simulator based on Open Dynamics Engine</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A characteristic of Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) is  an open source physics (rigid body dynamics) engine  and it is easy to use. I introduce it as follows.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">* License<span style="font-family: &quot;ＭＳ 明朝&quot;;">：ODE is free software and can be redistributed under</span><a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.html">Gnu Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>or<a href="http://ode.org/ode-license.html">BSD-style license</a>.  You can use it on business with no money.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">*  It is easy to use it<span style="font-family: &quot;ＭＳ 明朝&quot;;">：</span>Because three-dimensional computer graphics library (OpenGL) and collision detection mechanism are incorporated, I can use it immediately. A manual keeps strong, and sample programs are sufficient, too. Furthermore, ODE's community is activre, too and can read a past mailing list in a website.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">*  High speed<span style="font-family: &quot;ＭＳ 明朝&quot;;">：</span>Because it is used for commercial game engines, speed is high-speed. I am suitable for studies such as hereditary algorithm, reinforcement learning. Many researchers used it for simulation in a robot society of this year. But precision is not suitable for a demanded use because calculation precision is not high.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">*  Multi-platform<span style="font-family: &quot;ＭＳ 明朝&quot;;">：</span>It can be used on Windows, Linux and Mac. Software working only in Linux is diffcult to use in a class.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">*  C/C++ language<span style="font-family: &quot;ＭＳ 明朝&quot;;">：</span>A programming language is OK in both C and C++.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let's install ODE and the development environment in the next tutorial!</p>
