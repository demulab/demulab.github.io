<div class="entry-body">
<p>This page was mainly translated from http://demura.net/archives/9ode by <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">Babel Fish Translation</a>.</p>
<p>ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) tutorial  is  10th.</p>
<p>Well, you explain the parameter which this time is  peculiar to ODE. With ODE CFM (Contratint Force Mixing) with  there is a parameter which is said other than ERP.</p>
<p>There are two types of constraint, these are<span style="color: #990000;"><strong>a hard constraint</strong></span>and a <span style="color: #990000;"><strong>soft constraint.</strong></span>With hard restraint  constraint must be protected sincerely, be sure. On the one  hand, software restraint slips adaptability being effective, more or  less being to be OK. It meaning that a hard constraint is many  generally, it does, but it becomes a soft constraint with ODE by  introducing CFM. When CFM 0 being, as a hard constraint, it becomes large, it becomes a soft constraint.</p>
<p>In addition, with ODE it meaning that when constraints and  the joint are used in the same meaning is many, when you list the joint  to example, with a hard constraint you do not have to tear the constraint of the joint altogether. In other words, the position of the  axis of rotation of the joint and two links where direction is  connected a little do not have to slip. On the one hand, with  a soft constraint some joint center and it meaning that direction of  the axis may slip, physical like the living thing, the soft joint it  is simulating possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, also simulating the spring damper system is  possible by using previous ERP and latest CFM. Because contact  of the land and the foot when it makes the spring damper model is many with simulation of humanoid, also such simulation  sufficiently is possible with ODE. As for details please see<a title="E359" href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=ja_en&amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fode.org%2fode-latest-userguide.html" target="_self">the ODE manual</a>.</p>
<p>Next, it explains the concrete using of CFM.</p></div>
<p><!-- ▼追記▼ --></p>
<div class="entry-more">When CFM is set, API below is used. Furthermore,  this works to global and operates all joints. The default value  of CFM in case of single precision in case of 10E-5 and double  precision becomes 10E-10.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000066;"><strong>void  dWorldSetCFM (dWorldID , dReal cfm)</strong></span><br />
Here, as for dWorldID ID number of world, as for  cfm the value of CFM.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, please insert dWorldSetCFM in the line under dWorldSetERP<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=ja_en&amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fdemura.net%2farchives%2fimages%2fode%2fsample4a.tgz" target="_self">of  sample4a</a>modify the value of CFM try playing various types as a  practice, and. When the value of CFM is enlarged, the joint  becomes soft. When it makes small, 0 being smallest, in this  case it becomes hard restraint. CFM as for negative value it  meaning that the system becomes unstable please stop.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because there is the function which makes  simulation stabilize in CFM, behavior of the object in case of strange we recommend that value is enlarged little by little, but with usual  use 10E-3 (10^-3) is good even with when it is large, probably  will be. It is too large, when like the thick malt syrup it  becomes too soft.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p></div>
