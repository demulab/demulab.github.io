<p><strong>A s</strong><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>creen shot in figure Yellow Dog Linux 5.0 for  PlayStation3</strong>: Cpuinfo is indicated in the  terminal the left. Cell Broadband Engine is recognized 2, it is found that machine is recognized PS3PF.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The  standard window manager of YDL is Enlightenment, but it has modified  in gnome.</span></p>
<p>ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) Tutorial time it became 15th.   This time shows that installation of  a Linux and Open Dynamics Engine into a PlayStation 3 (PS3) .</p>
<p>The Yellow Dog Linux which cuts the predecessor in one for PS3 5.0 (YDL5.0) free download (English) edition was used in the  distribution of Linxu. The<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=ja_en&amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fdeveloper.momonga-linux.org%2fwiki%2f%3fPS3">Momonga Linux</a>(20061217editions) being to try before YDL, it  does, but why firefox without starting it cries the problematical  point which falls immediately and because is not sound, you abandoned  that it cries and uses. The Momonga Linux is the unique distribution which succeeds the will of  Kondara Linux which I regularly use at one  time.  A lovely momonga  is large popularity even in the kid.  You will expect to future!</p>
<p>Well, because as for the method of installing Yellow Dog  Linux 5.0 to Playstation3 super being simple, the detailed explanation with FIXSTARS is a web sight below, please view there. Including also preparation, and the like if there are also 2 hours, you think  installation that it ends. In case of me, in 10GB and one for  Game OS it guaranteed the hard disk territory of 50GB in one for  Linux, 1GB guaranteed the swap territory of Linux.</p>
<p><strong>1.  The installation  Yellow  Dog Linux 5.0</strong></p>

</ul>

<p><strong>2.  Enviroment for software development  in order to move ODE it sets</strong></p>
<p>As for YDL5.0 when installing it is not possible  to choose the package, with just that cannot move ODE. ODE it  meaning that GLU which is the utility library of OpenGL is necessary,  must install that package and must set the setting file xorg.conf of X Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The installation of GLU<br />
Unless GLU is installed, following kind of error message being made, it cannot compile.<br />
Drawstuff.cpp:49:20: Error: GL/glu.h: No such  file or directory</p>
<p>Rpm below was installed in order to solve that.<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=ja_en&amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fftp.kddlabs.co.jp%2fLinux%2fdistributions%2fyellowdog%2fyum%2f5.0%2fbase%2fRPMS%2f">These rpm are found here.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mesa-libGLU-devel-6.4.2-6.FC5.3.ppc.rpm</li>
<li>Freeglut-devel-2.4.0-4.ppc.rpm</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The setting of /etc/X11/xorg.conf<br />
When it continues to be the standard setting of YDL5.0,  when moving the test program of ODE, error below comes out.<br />
Xlib: Extension "GLX" missing ON display ": 0.0  "<br />
Error: No good X11 visual found for OpenGL</p>
<p>In order to evade this error, Load "glx" is added to  Section "Module" of /etc/X11/xorg.conf. I Load "type1" and  "#Load" dri "am inserting between.<br />
Load "type1"<br />
Load "glx"<br />
#Load "dri"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.  The installation of ODE</strong></p>
<p>The installation itself of ODE completely is the  same as normal Linux. Please read my page below.</p>

<p><strong>4.  Place impression<br />

<p><strong>A login screenshot  of  YDL 5.0 (1080p vide mode of PS3)</strong></p>
<p>The television of full hi-vision of the home the computer (PS3)  as for becoming the picture very is refreshing. However, being  not to be able to use the hardware acceleration of OpenGL at present,  in order to use ODE, it is not practical. In addition, being  memory to be only 256 MB, when you use GNOME and the like, it is  rather heavy, is. Furthermore, the POWER PC interchangeable main processor core PPE which has been utilized with YDL is the feeling  such as CPU before the generation bodily sensation.</p>
<p>The negative thing was written, but advanced numerical  operational core SPE of the CELL processor (Synergistic Processor  Element) you use and being to be, the truth of PS3 you are enormous,  it is not found yet. When in the future, problem of OpenGL  support and the application which utilizes SPE arise, as for PS3  personal it is not to become the super computer, probably will be?  It meaning that also price is approximately 60000 Yen with the  hard disk 60GB on-board model, it is good bargain. For the time  being we would like to keep using as the computer for education of  child. When Linux is inserted, with standard it meaning that  Game OS does not stand up, it can also avoid the game doing too much  of child, for the pad it is grateful, is.</p>
