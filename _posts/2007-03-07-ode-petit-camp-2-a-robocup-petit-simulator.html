<p>This time time it becomes serialization 2nd.  Although serialization to turn and serve all 4 it does not  relate, glee D (greedy) the last time because it designates that the  petit simulator of 2 walking robots is made as goal, this time the  wheel type robot, the petit simulator of the robot arm keeps making  the next time steadily.</p>
<p>Because with RoboCon Magazine the space is  limited, you cannot explain in detail. In order in this page to  supply that, the all source code and the luxurious supplement of the  sample program?</p>
