<p>Most of this page was translated from http://demura.net/archives/9ode by <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">Babel Fish Translation</a>. Sorry for strange and funny English from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">the Chinese room</a>".</p>

<p>The ODE book, Robot simulation - Robot programming with  Open Dynamics Engine ", C language and the open source physics engine ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) , targetting the reader robot engineering has not been learned, the foundation of robot engineering you learn the method of programming that gradually.</p>
<p>Necessary knowledges are only mathematics of high school and C language of beginners' class level. The lesson begins from falling of the apple, the wheel type robot, the robot arm, 4 leg robots and step-up to the lovely humanoid robot, Kensei-chan. Making a dynamics walking program is the last mission.</p>
<p>In the ODE book, you can learn how to make simulators which used 3D graphics shown above (they are all simulations in the ODE book) and you can also learn the basic of robotics. A physics engine like ODE is necessary to make games realistices, has becoming indispensable. It means that knowledge of robotics are necessary for a game developper.</p>
<p>Why don't you try to control robots in the virtual space?</p>
